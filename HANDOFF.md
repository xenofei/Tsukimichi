# Handoff

Updated 2026-10-08. To resume, read this file and `git log -5`, then `docs/team/agent-brief-common.md`.

## Goal
Moonfall, plan v9 (`docs/feature-plan-v9.md`): a Peggle-like game inside Tsukimichi.
- **Shipped:** 1.23.0 "Moonfall preview", with the menus and screens and the first 10 of 115 levels.
- **Next:** the remaining 105 levels, then the full release (version after 1.23.0).
- **Running alongside:** the workflow changes from `docs/team/workflow-audit-2026-10-06.md`, all approved by the owner.

## Done
- **1.23.0 is released,** with the tag pushed and pluginmaster checked. The owner tested it in game on 7 October and the preview works.
- **Optimization team:** eight `opt-*` specialists in `.claude/agents/`. The roster is in `docs/team/optimization-team.md`.
- **Audit and owner approvals:**
  - the shared brief `docs/team/agent-brief-common.md`;
  - `tools/claude-usage/monitor.py` and `save_report.py`;
  - `.claude/settings.json`: fallback model, `autoCompactWindow` 400k, retry watchdog;
  - the global CLAUDE.md trimmed;
  - the smoke-test pages removed.
- **Sources plan:** `docs/design/v9/levels/sources-plan.md`, with the owner's answers (Fan Kit ships with a © notice).
- **Pipeline prep, merged:** stage keys `mr1`–`mr11` and `fs1`–`fs12`, `mfl.py challenge`, and the Ace rule for hard levels.
- **Flaky tests fixed:** the save writer has its own thread; the allocation tests take the smallest of 5 windows (owner-approved); the gate's rerun list is empty.
- **Stage MR 3 shipped to main** (7be2978f): base-11 to base-15, approved in round 2. The pilot cost 391M input tokens; its single fold-in took 42%, so the fold-in is now split per level. The runtime crop rounds to 8-bit steps between passes, as the pipeline does.
- **Charter for the 105 levels:** `docs/design/v9/levels/charter.md`, with the owner's answers of 7 October.
- **Gate wrapper and caches:** `pwsh tools/gate.ps1` (skips an unchanged tree) and the caches for `mfl.py build`/`stage` and MoonfallRender `--cache`.

## In flight (2026-10-09, evening)
- **MR 6 round 2:** the game designer approves; UX and the critic are finishing. When approved, merge MR 6's branch into main and then main into `moonfall-peggle`.
- **The Peggle integration branch `moonfall-peggle`** (worktree `.claude/worktrees/moonfall-peggle`) has:
  - the engine's Peggle rules (69566a4c). On its own this fails the 5-of-48 gate on base-20/23/25 and the self-test's base-p2 pilot case; the refit fixes both;
  - the pipeline rules, from main (bcbf1531).
- **Recalibration agent:** working on `moonfall-peggle`. It replays Peggle's campaigns on the new engine with the scratch kit and sets `MEAN_BANDS` mr1–11 and fs1–12 and the finale gap (Deluxe → Moon Road, Nights → Far Shore), with the 5-of-48 floor.
- **Main stays green.** Nothing from the Peggle work reaches main until the refit passes every gate.

## Next
1. **Refit MR 1–6 on `moonfall-peggle`,** a workflow per stage: densify to 95–115 pieces at r 10 and t 20, the candidate share, re-tune to the new bands, re-suggest Aces, convert, reviews.
2. **Merge `moonfall-peggle` into main** when the gates pass, and run the full check.
3. **Continue MR 7–11 and FS 1–12** under the new rules.
   - Far Shore stage 1 ships the two Fan Kit wallpapers with a "© SQUARE ENIX" notice in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` (owner's answer).
   - Point `challenges.json` ch-04 at `base-37` when it ships (ch-03 already points at `base-27`, from MR 6).
4. **The full release,** after all 115 levels: version 1.24.0 or later, What's new, changelog. Ask the owner before pushing.
   - At the full release, Moonfall gets its own button on the main window (owner, 7 October).

## Open
- **Owner items:** none open. The unused user-level agents and skills stay as they are (owner, 7 October).
- **Not verified in game:** GPU drawing, live motion, the keyboard and gamepad reveal, scene build speed, and 1-3's Fever moon.

## Gates
`pwsh tools/gate.ps1`. The raw commands are the fallback, in `docs/team/agent-brief-common.md`. Levels: `py -3 tools/moonfall-levels/mfl.py selftest`, `stage 1`, `stage 2` and `convert --all --check`.

## Do not
- Never push, tag or release without asking the owner.
- Never resume a stalled agent whose context is large; start a fresh one from a handoff.
- Never read whole transcripts; use the monitor and `save_report.py`.
